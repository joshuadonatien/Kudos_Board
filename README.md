### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

There were no labs for this assignment, but previous projects definitely helped in completing the assignment. Some features that I felt unprepared to compelete was the incorporation of frontend to backend as it was still a new concept.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If there was more time, some of the features that would have been implemented include pinning boards and add features for the users to comment under cards. Something that would have been done differently would be creating a solid plan before implementing different aspects of the website.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Some things that went well was for the project and presentation to be solid. Some things that could be improved upon are different css aspects such as making sure things are aligned, same sized cards, etc.
